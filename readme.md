# Quack! 🦆

Hi  I'm Duckers, a teenager web dev, problem solver and problem creator.
I love theatre and coding, which some people say is a really strange combo, and you know what i say to that? Yes, it probably is. 

Anyway, i should probably keep this short because its a github bio and they are always short... one last thing though - are you a lawyer? i need help. my cup of tea just filed a police report againt me - said it had been mugged!
